# Dan Seskey - Professional Portfolio

Welcome to the repository of my professional portfolio! This application was built using a ##template React app absed on the create-react-app CLI. 

## About the application
The application, which can be accessed [here](https://dseskey.github.io/portoflio) contains four sections 

### Sections
The application is split into four sections: About Me, Portfolio, Contact and Resume.

#### About Me
The About Me section 

#### Portfolio

#### Contact

#### Resume

### Additional Libraries

The application was written using several reusable React libaries such as:

## [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io)
The React Bootstrap library promotes reusable components for items such as layouts, cards, navigation, etc. This library was used for the project cards shown in the Portfolio section, layouts across the application, form fields and alert banners in the Contact section, mobile and desktop nav items in the Navigation component, and more!

## [React Social Icons](https://github.com/jaketrent/react-social-icons#readme)
The React Social Icons library provided the social media icons you see across the application. This includes the Github and Linkedin icons in the footer, and the Github, iTunes Store, and Youtube icons shown on the project cards.

# Running Locally
To run locally, clone the repository to your machine. Navigate to the project directory where the code was saved and run the following commands:

### `npm install` 

Installs all necessary libraries required for the application.

### `npm start`

Runs the application in development mode on your local machine. Upon starting, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. These tests include component level test as well as tests integrations of child components into their parents. For example, when testing the Header there is a test to ensure the Navigation component rendered as well. Additionally, the Portfolio tests check how many Project components were rendered.
